Have failed so far to get jest to work with api.ts, related to esm import issues.

Currently trying to get test_feai_requests.ts to work:

npx ts-node --project tsconfig.test.json src/test/test_feai_requests.ts

This gives Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module...

However:

npx ts-node --project tsconfig.test.json src/run_server.ts

seems to work perfectly, both are using the same config...

Maybe the issue stems from package.json?
